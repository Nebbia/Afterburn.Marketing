  headline: <strong>2x</strong> Your Team's Impact
  content:
    <p>What would you do if you could deliver updates twice as often, with half as many mistakes?</p>
    
    <p>We at Nebbia Technology have helped dozens of organizations transform their software delivery processes over the past four years. We've helped teams more than 2x their delivery schedule, and because of that, they can experiment and change direction more than twice as much. We’re big on helping people take their software ideas and get them into production ASAP, whether that’s the first line of code or the millionth. We are developers and consultants that simply love seeing our clients move faster and do better.</p>

    <p>We've also learned a lot of hard-earned lessons so you don't have to. You've got your team and your customers to think about, and it's natural for focusing on the software delivery process to take a back seat sometimes. Let us help you supercharge your knowledge and get your team on the path toward elite software delivery performance.</p>

    <p>Our first step is to bring you and your team up to speed with what we are measuring and why. It all starts with three days of training and evaluation. Throughout this time, we will work with your team to understand the specific pain points they are facing in software delivery and train the whole team on what works, what doesn't, and why.</p>
